Okay, with a first-author MICCAI paper and a sixth-author CVPR paper, you have a very strong and relevant background for RA positions, especially in labs focusing on **AI for Medical Imaging, Computer Vision in Healthcare, Computational Pathology/Radiology**, and related areas. NYC is an excellent place for this, with top universities and medical centers heavily investing in this field.

Here's a list of potential professors/labs across major NYC institutions whose research areas align well with your background. You should look them up, check their recent publications, and see if their specific projects excite you. An RA position often involves supporting ongoing projects, so aligning with their current work is crucial.

**Focus Areas to Look For:** Medical Image Analysis, Deep Learning for Healthcare, Computational Pathology, Computational Radiology, Computer-Assisted Diagnosis/Surgery, Machine Learning for Biomedical Data.

**Potential Advisors/Labs (Grouped by Institution):**

**1. New York University (NYU)**

* **NYU Langone Health (Radiology, Pathology, CAI²R, Center for Data Science):**
  * **Krzysztof Geras:** Focuses on deep learning for medical imaging, particularly breast cancer screening (mammography, MRI). Strong ML/CV focus, frequent publications in MICCAI, MIDL, Nature Medicine. (Highly relevant).
  * **Florian Knoll:** Works on AI for medical imaging reconstruction (especially MRI) and analysis. Connects signal processing, machine learning, and imaging physics. (Relevant, especially if interested in reconstruction + analysis).
  * **Narges Razavian:** Applies ML/DL to various healthcare data, including imaging, though often broader than just vision (EHR integration). Check recent imaging-focused projects.
  * **Yvonne W. Lui:** Chair of Radiology, involved in neuroradiology AI applications. Check her lab/collaborators for specific projects.
  * **Linda Moy:** Focuses on AI in breast imaging.
  * *Check faculty within the Center for Advanced Imaging Innovation and Research (CAI²R) and the Tech4Health Institute.*
* **NYU Courant Institute of Mathematical Sciences (Computer Science):**
  * While famous for core AI/ML (LeCun, Cho, Pinto), look for faculty specifically collaborating with Langone or applying CV to medical/biological domains. Sometimes PhD students/postdocs bridge this gap. Lerrel Pinto's lab works on robotics/vision, sometimes with medical applications (e.g., surgical robotics).
* **NYU Tandon School of Engineering:**
  * **Yao Wang:** Works on video processing, computer vision, and biomedical imaging applications.

**2. Columbia University**

* **Computer Science Department:**
  * **Carl Vondrick:** Core CV/ML researcher, works on video understanding, self-supervised learning. Check for any medical imaging collaborations/projects.
  * **Shih-Fu Chang:** Multimedia, CV, large-scale visual recognition. Might have healthcare-related projects.
* **Biomedical Engineering (BME):**
  * **Andrew Laine:** Focuses on medical image analysis (CT, MRI, Ultrasound, Histopathology), quantitative imaging biomarkers. (Very relevant).
  * **Paul Sajda:** Works on neural engineering, computational neuroscience, and image/signal analysis, often applied to neuroimaging (EEG, fMRI).
  * **Jia Guo:** Neuroimaging (MRI, PET) analysis using ML/DL for neurological and psychiatric disorders. (Relevant if interested in brain imaging).
* **Columbia University Irving Medical Center (CUIMC - Radiology, Pathology, DBMI):**
  * Faculty within Radiology and Pathology departments increasingly use AI. Look for specific labs.
  * *Department of Biomedical Informatics (DBMI):* While often EHR-focused, some faculty like Adler Perotte or others might work with imaging data.

**3. Cornell Tech / Weill Cornell Medicine**

* **Cornell Tech:**
  * **Fei Wang:** Leading researcher in AI for Healthcare, ML, data mining. Works with various data types including potentially imaging. (Highly relevant).
  * **Serge Belongie:** Core CV researcher. Check for health tech or medical imaging applications/collaborations.
  * **Noah Snavely:** CV/Graphics. Check for relevant applications.
* **Weill Cornell Medicine:**
  * **Iman Hajirasouliha:** Computational biology and medical informatics, with a focus on computational pathology / analysis of histology images using AI/ML. (Highly relevant).
  * **Olivier Elemento:** Director of the Englander Institute for Precision Medicine, computational biology, AI in cancer research, potentially including imaging data.
  * *Check faculty within Radiology and Pathology, especially those affiliated with the Englander Institute.* Joseph Osborne (Radiology AI).

**4. Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai**

* **Hess Center for AI / Various Departments (Radiology, Pathology, Genetics):** Mount Sinai has a significant push in AI for healthcare.
  * **Zahi Fayad:** Director of the BioMedical Engineering and Imaging Institute (BMEII), focuses on cardiovascular imaging and AI applications.
  * **Benjamin Glicksberg:** AI in medicine, works with diverse data including imaging for clinical insights.
  * **Eric Oermann:** Neurosurgery, applies AI/ML to clinical and imaging data in neurosurgery.
  * *Search faculty within the BMEII, Hess Center for Computationally Augmented Radiology and AI (CARL-AI), Pathology, and Radiology departments specifically mentioning AI/ML/Deep Learning.*

**5. Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)**

* **Computational Pathology / Radiology / Computational Oncology:** MSKCC is a powerhouse in cancer research, including computational aspects.
  * **Thomas Fuchs:** Pioneer in computational pathology (though now also affiliated elsewhere, his influence/lab legacy at MSK is strong). Look for current leaders in this space at MSK. Mohammadian Behrooz is active here.
  * **Joseph Deasy:** Chair of Medical Physics, research includes AI applications in radiation oncology and medical imaging.
  * *Explore labs within the Departments of Pathology, Radiology, Medical Physics, and the Kravis Center for Molecular Oncology.* Andreas Rimner (Radiation Oncology AI).

**How to Approach Finding an RA Position:**

1. **Research Deeply:** Don't just rely on this list. Go to the department/lab websites. Read the professors' recent papers (especially those related to MICCAI/CVPR topics). Understand their *current* research direction.
2. **Look for Openings:** Check university HR websites, lab websites ("Join Us" / "Open Positions" pages), and department job boards for formal RA postings.
3. **Cold Email (Highly Personalized):** This is often necessary.
    * **Subject Line:** Clear and informative (e.g., "Prospective Research Assistant Inquiry - [Your Name] - MICCAI/CVPR Background").
    * **Body:**
        * Briefly introduce yourself and your current status (CS Master's student in the US).
        * **Crucially, mention your MICCAI 1st author and CVPR 6th author papers.** This immediately signals your capability.
        * **Show you've done your homework:** Mention 1-2 *specific* recent papers or projects from *their lab* that interest you and *briefly* explain why, connecting it to your own experience (e.g., "I was particularly interested in your recent work on [Specific Topic] published in [Venue], as my MICCAI paper also explored [Related Technique/Problem] in the context of [Your Application]").
        * State your interest in an RA position and how you believe your skills (mention key ones like Python, PyTorch/TensorFlow, specific imaging analysis techniques) can contribute to their ongoing research.
        * Express interest in potentially pursuing a PhD in the future (if applicable), framing the RA role as valuable preparation.
        * Keep it concise and professional.
        * **Attach your CV.**
4. **Target Assistant/Associate Professors:** They are often actively building their labs and may have more need/funding for RAs compared to very senior professors.
5. **Be Persistent (but polite):** Follow up once if you don't hear back after a week or two. Faculty are very busy.
6. **Network:** If you know anyone (students, postdocs) in these labs or departments, ask for an introduction or advice. Attend virtual seminars if possible.

Your publication record is a significant asset for securing an RA position in these competitive labs. Good luck with your search!
