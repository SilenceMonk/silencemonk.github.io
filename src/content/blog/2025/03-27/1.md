**Core Concepts:**

1. A **minimal path unit** represents either a point-to-point journey (via walking, public transit, or driving) or a route imported/shared from Google Maps.
2. Path units can be arbitrarily combined to form an **itinerary**. Furthermore, itineraries can be arbitrarily combined to create higher-level, **nested itineraries**.
3. Any minimal path unit can be modified, which should update the overall itinerary's **estimated time of arrival (ETA)** and **cost**.
4. Periodically and automatically update the itinerary's estimated ETA and cost (e.g., based on real-time data if available).
5. Any modification to an itinerary that results in a **conflict** (e.g., overlapping time windows between segments or itineraries) will trigger a visual indicator (like a **red dot**) on the affected itinerary, and the system should attempt to automatically **re-plan** to resolve the conflict.

**Technology Stack Proposal:**

### I. Frontend Technology Stack (Web First)

1. **Core Framework:**
    - **Next.js** + TypeScript
2. **State Management:**
    - **Redux Toolkit** + **Immer**
    - *Reason:* Needed for handling potentially deeply nested itinerary structures. Immer simplifies immutable state updates, and Redux DevTools aids in debugging complex state changes.
3. **Visualization Components:**
    - Drag-and-drop sorting: `react-beautiful-dnd`
    - Map integration: `@react-google-maps/api`
    - ... (Other UI elements as needed)
4. **UI Framework:**
    - **shadcn/ui**

### II. Backend Technology Stack

1. **Runtime:**
    - **Node.js** (Using Express or NestJS framework)
2. **Core Services:**
    - **Routing Engine:** Integrate **Google Maps API** (Directions API, Distance Matrix API, etc.)
    - **Conflict Detection Service:** Custom algorithm based on time windows (potentially using an **Interval Tree** implementation).
    - **Itinerary Conflict Resolution/Re-planning Algorithm:** [Needs definition - could involve shifting times, suggesting alternatives, or flagging for manual resolution].
3. **Database:**
    - **PostgreSQL** + **PostGIS** (for efficient geospatial data storage and querying).
4. **Real-time Calculation Architecture:**
    - Handles updates propagating through the nested itinerary structure.

    ```mermaid
    graph LR
       A[Path Unit Modification] --> B[Propagate Update Upwards]
       B --> C{Is Root Node?}
       C -->|No| D[Update Parent Node Time/Cost]
       D --> B
       C -->|Yes| E[Trigger Conflict Detection]
       E --> F[Display Visual Indicator (e.g., Red Dot)]
       E --> G[Attempt Automatic Re-planning]
    ```

    *(Note: Added G based on requirement 5)*

### III. Deployment Plan

1. **Frontend Deployment:**
    - Platform: **Vercel** (Ideal for Next.js applications)
2. **Backend Deployment:**
    - Platform: **AWS EC2** (or other cloud VM/container service like AWS Fargate, Google Cloud Run, etc.)
