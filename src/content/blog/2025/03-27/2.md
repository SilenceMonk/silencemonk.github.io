**Time Allocation Strategy:**

Given the density of Neetcode topics and the hands-on nature of Kiefer's course, plus project work, an equal split seems reasonable as a starting point.

* **Neetcode:** ~40 hours (10 hours/week)
* **Kiefer's Course:** ~40 hours (10 hours/week)
* **FuGo App Dev:** ~40 hours (10 hours/week)

**Daily Schedule Template (Monday - Friday):**

* **10:30 - 12:30 (2 hours): Neetcode**
  * *Why:* Tackle the most logically demanding tasks when you're likely freshest. Algorithms and data structures require focused thinking.
* **14:00 - 16:00 (2 hours): Kiefer's Course**
  * *Why:* Mix of theory and practical application (requires a keyboard/piano). Can be a good change of pace after lunch.
* **16:00 - 18:00 (2 hours): FuGo App Development**
  * *Why:* Creative problem-solving and coding. Can build momentum towards the end of the day.

**Weekly Breakdown (4 Weeks):**

This is a suggested pace. Be flexible! Some topics might take longer, others might be quicker. Prioritize understanding the *concepts* and *patterns* (especially for Neetcode and Kiefer) over just checking off items.

**Week 1: Foundations**

  * Thu: Basic manual time/cost input for path units. Calculate and display total time/cost for a Trip.
  * Fri: Refine UI for nested structure. Start thinking about Google Maps API for actual path data.

**Week 3: Advanced Structures & Reharmonization**

* **Neetcode (10h):** Trees, Heaps, Backtracking Intro
  * Mon: Trees - Trie (Implement Trie)
  * Tue: Trees - Trie (Design Add/Search Words) or Union-Find (Redundant Connection) - Pick one focus.
  * Wed: Heaps - Two Heaps (Find Median From Data Stream - *This is Hard, focus on understanding*)
  * Thu: Backtracking - Subsets (Subsets I)
  * Fri: Backtracking - Subsets (Subsets II) or Combinations (Combinations) + Weekly Review
* **Kiefer (10h):** Voicings & Deeper Reharm
  * Mon: Reharmonizing Intervals (Ex 1: Same Note Top, Walk Bass Down - practice C and G melody notes).
  * Tue: Reharmonizing Intervals (Ex 2/3: Stick to Chord Type / Bass Note is 3).
  * Wed: Voicings Exercises (Minor 7th chords - develop voicings for each Dorian scale note in Cmin, Fmin).

  * Mon-Tue: Integrate Google Maps Directions API to fetch time/distance for path units (replace manual input). Store results.
  * Wed: Implement update propagation: when a unit's time changes, update parent trip's total time.
  * Thu: Design conflict detection logic (simple time window overlap check). Implement data structure for time windows.
  * Fri: Basic UI indication for conflicts (e.g., red dot). Start backend setup (Node.js/Express basic server).

**Week 4: Graphs, DP, Advanced Harmony & Project Refinement**

  * Tue: Refine conflict detection algorithm. Consider edge cases.

  * Thu: Backend: Define API endpoints (Save Trip, Load Trip). Setup basic DB (PostgreSQL) schema.
  * Fri: Connect frontend to basic backend endpoints. General UI polish and bug fixing.

**Key Success Factors:**

1. **Consistency:** Stick to the schedule as much as possible. Even showing up for a slightly shorter session is better than skipping.
2. **Active Learning:**
    * **Neetcode:** *Try* solving before looking at solutions/videos. Understand the *why* behind the algorithm, not just the code. Redo problems you struggled with a few days later.
    * **Kiefer:** You *must* practice at a keyboard/piano. Record yourself. Apply concepts immediately, even to simple tunes like "Twinkle Twinkle." Experiment!
    * **FuGo:** Break down features into small, manageable tasks. Commit code frequently. Don't aim for perfection initially; aim for working functionality.
3. **Review:** Briefly review the previous day's material at the start of each session. Dedicate part of Friday to reviewing the week's topics.
4. **Flexibility:** This plan is dense. If you fall behind on a topic, don't panic. Adjust the next week's plan. Maybe substitute a listed Neetcode problem for one you're stuck on. Prioritize core concepts.
5. **Rest:** 6 hours of focused learning/coding per day is intense. Ensure you get enough sleep and take breaks *outside* your scheduled time. Don't burn out.

This schedule provides a strong framework. Good luck with your month of learning and building!
