Okay, let's design the FuGo app for Android and outline a development roadmap.

## FuGo App Design

**1. Core Concepts:**

* **`ItineraryComponent`:** An abstract concept representing a piece of a journey. This will be the base for both Minimal Path Units and Itineraries. It needs methods/properties for:
  * `getStartTime()`, `getEndTime()`, `getDuration()`
  * `getEstimatedCost()`
  * `getID()`
  * `getName()`
  * `hasConflict()` (Boolean flag)
  * `getParentID()` (Nullable, for hierarchy)
* **`MinimalPathUnit` (MPU):** Concrete implementation of `ItineraryComponent`.
  * **Properties:**
    * `type`: Enum (WALK, TRANSIT, DRIVE, IMPORTED_MAPS)
    * `startLocation`: Address/Coordinates
    * `endLocation`: Address/Coordinates
    * `specifiedStartTime`: Optional user-defined start time.
    * `specifiedEndTime`: Optional user-defined end time.
    * `baseDuration`: Calculated or manually entered duration (without real-time factors).
    * `baseCost`: Estimated or manually entered cost.
    * `realTimeDuration`: Updated duration based on real-time data.
    * `realTimeCost`: Updated cost (e.g., dynamic transit fares, tolls).
    * `routeDetails`: Polyline, transit line info, driving directions (from API or import).
    * `sourceDetails`: Info if imported (e.g., Google Maps share link).
  * **Calculated Properties (derived):**
    * `effectiveStartTime`: The actual calculated start time based on sequence and `specifiedStartTime`.
    * `effectiveEndTime`: `effectiveStartTime` + `realTimeDuration` (or `baseDuration` if real-time unavailable).
    * `effectiveCost`: `realTimeCost` (or `baseCost`).
* **`Itinerary`:** Concrete implementation of `ItineraryComponent`, acting as a container.
  * **Properties:**
    * `name`: User-defined name (e.g., "Trip to London", "Morning Commute").
    * `description`: Optional details.
    * `children`: Ordered List of `ItineraryComponent` IDs (referencing MPUs or other Itineraries).
  * **Calculated Properties (derived):**
    * `calculatedStartTime`: The `effectiveStartTime` of its first child.
    * `calculatedEndTime`: The `effectiveEndTime` of its last child.
    * `calculatedTotalDuration`: Sum of durations of children + potential wait times between them.
    * `calculatedTotalCost`: Sum of `effectiveCost` of all children (recursive).
    * `containsConflict`: Boolean flag, true if any child `hasConflict()` or if there's an overlap between children.

**2. Data Structure & Persistence:**

* **Database:** Use Room Persistence Library.
  * A table for `ItineraryComponent` holding common properties (ID, name, parentID, conflict status, type discriminator - MPU/Itinerary).
  * A table for `MinimalPathUnit` specific details (linked via ID).
  * A table for `Itinerary` specific details (linked via ID).
  * A linking table or structure within `Itinerary` to manage the ordered list of child IDs, preserving the sequence.
* **In-Memory Representation:** Use Kotlin data classes mirroring the database structure. Employ the Composite Design Pattern where `Itinerary` can hold a list of `ItineraryComponent` objects (which could be `MinimalPathUnit` or other `Itinerary` instances).

**3. Core Logic:**

* **Calculation Engine:**
  * Traverse the itinerary tree (depth-first or breadth-first).
  * For an `Itinerary`, calculate its properties based on its children. The `effectiveStartTime` of child `N+1` depends on the `effectiveEndTime` of child `N` unless specific times are set.
  * Updates should propagate upwards: Modifying an MPU triggers recalculation for its parent `Itinerary`, which triggers its parent, and so on, up to the root. Use `LiveData` or `StateFlow` to observe changes and trigger UI updates.
* **Real-time Update Service:**
  * Use `WorkManager` for reliable, periodic background tasks.
  * The task identifies active/upcoming MPUs that support real-time data (DRIVE, TRANSIT).
  * Query Google Maps Directions API (or similar) with current time and known parameters (`startLocation`, `endLocation`, `modeOfTransport`, potentially `departure_time` or `arrival_time` constraints).
  * Update the `realTimeDuration` and `realTimeCost` for the relevant MPUs in the database.
  * Trigger the calculation engine to update affected itineraries.
  * *Considerations:* API costs, battery usage (use sensible intervals, only update relevant segments).
* **Conflict Detection:**
  * Run checks after any modification or real-time update that affects timing.
  * Within an `Itinerary`, iterate through its ordered children `(i, i+1)`.
  * A conflict exists if `child[i].effectiveEndTime > child[i+1].effectiveStartTime`.
  * Also check if an MPU's `effectiveDuration` exceeds any `specifiedStartTime`/`specifiedEndTime` constraints.
  * Mark the `hasConflict` flag on the `ItineraryComponent` (MPU or Itinerary) where the conflict originates *and* on the parent `Itinerary` containing the conflicting sequence. Propagate a `containsConflict` status upwards.
* **Automatic Re-planning (Initial Strategy):**
  * **Detection:** Identify the conflicting pair `(child[i], child[i+1])`.
  * **Simple Resolution Attempt:** Calculate the overlap duration (`child[i].effectiveEndTime - child[i+1].effectiveStartTime`). Shift `child[i+1]` and all subsequent children within the *same parent itinerary* later by this overlap duration (+ a small buffer).
  * **Failure/Complex Cases:** If shifting creates new conflicts, or if constraints prevent shifting (e.g., a later item has a fixed `specifiedStartTime`), the automatic re-plan fails.
  * **Outcome:** If successful, clear the conflict flags. If failed, leave the conflict flags set (the red dot remains) for manual user intervention. More complex strategies (suggesting alternative routes, changing modes) are future enhancements.

**4. User Interface (UI) / User Experience (UX):**

* **Main Screen:** List of top-level itineraries. Possibly a dashboard showing the next upcoming step across all itineraries.
* **Itinerary View:**
  * Use a `RecyclerView` with expandable items or a nested structure to display the hierarchy.
  * Clearly distinguish between MPUs and sub-itineraries.
  * Show summary (Total ETA/Cost) at the top.
  * Display calculated start/end times for each component.
  * Show a **red dot** icon next to any `ItineraryComponent` where `hasConflict` or `containsConflict` is true. Tapping it could show conflict details.
  * Allow adding new MPUs or existing itineraries.
  * Allow reordering items (drag-and-drop).
  * Allow editing/deleting components.
* **MPU Editor:**
  * Form to input/edit details: name, locations (via map picker/search), transport mode.
  * Option to specify fixed start/end times.
  * Display base and (if available) real-time duration/cost.
  * Button to fetch route/time estimate from Google Maps API.
* **Map Integration:** Use Google Maps SDK to visualize routes for MPUs or entire itineraries.
* **Import:** Handle Android's Share Intent to receive Google Maps URLs/routes. Parse the URL to create an `IMPORTED_MAPS` MPU.

**5. Key Technologies:**

* **Language:** Kotlin
* **Architecture:** MVVM (ViewModel, LiveData/StateFlow, Repository)
* **UI Toolkit:** Jetpack Compose (recommended for modern UI) or XML with ViewBinding.
* **Persistence:** Room
* **Background Tasks:** WorkManager
* **Networking:** Retrofit, OkHttp
* **Mapping:** Google Maps SDK for Android
* **Routing/Real-time Data:** Google Maps Directions API
* **Dependency Injection:** Hilt
* **Asynchronous Programming:** Kotlin Coroutines

## Development Roadmap

This roadmap breaks development into logical phases, starting with core functionality and progressively adding complexity.

**Phase 1: Core Data Model & Basic MPU/Itinerary Management (MVP)**

* **Goal:** Establish the foundation. Create, view, and manage simple, non-nested itineraries with manually defined MPUs.
* **Tasks:**
  * Set up project structure (MVVM, Hilt, Room, Coroutines).
  * Define Room entities for `ItineraryComponent`, `MinimalPathUnit`, `Itinerary` (non-nested initially).
  * Implement basic DAOs (Data Access Objects).
  * Create UI screens for:
    * Listing top-level Itineraries.
    * Viewing an Itinerary (list of MPUs).
    * Creating/Editing an MPU (manual entry: name, locations as text, mode, duration, cost).
    * Creating/Editing an Itinerary (name, description).
  * Implement basic calculation engine: Calculate total duration/cost for an itinerary based on its MPUs (no real-time, simple sequence).
  * Implement adding/removing MPUs from an Itinerary.

**Phase 2: Google Maps Integration & Basic Routing**

* **Goal:** Integrate mapping and automatically calculate MPU details.
* **Tasks:**
  * Integrate Google Maps SDK: Display map in MPU editor.
  * Implement location search/picker using Geocoding API / Places SDK.
  * Integrate Directions API:
    * When creating/editing an MPU, call API based on locations/mode to get `baseDuration`, `baseCost`, and `routeDetails`.
    * Store route polyline.
  * Update MPU editor UI to use API results.
  * Implement basic route display on a map view for a selected MPU.
  * Handle API keys and permissions (Location).
  * Implement basic Google Maps route import via Share Intent.

**Phase 3: Nested Itineraries & Hierarchical Calculations**

* **Goal:** Enable the core nesting feature.
* **Tasks:**
  * Update Room schema and DAOs to fully support the `parentID` relationship and ordered `children` list for `Itinerary`.
  * Update Calculation Engine to handle recursion: Calculate properties for nested itineraries correctly.
  * Implement efficient update propagation using `LiveData`/`StateFlow` (changes in deep MPU update all ancestors).
  * Update Itinerary View UI:
    * Display nested structure (e.g., using indentation or expandable lists).
    * Allow adding existing Itineraries as children to other Itineraries.
  * Refine navigation within the hierarchy.

**Phase 4: Real-time Updates**

* **Goal:** Automatically update ETAs/costs based on current conditions.
* **Tasks:**
  * Implement `WorkManager` background task.
  * Task logic: Identify relevant MPUs, query Directions API for real-time data (`departure_time=now`, traffic info).
  * Update `realTimeDuration`/`realTimeCost` in the database.
  * Ensure background updates trigger the calculation engine and UI updates.
  * Add UI indicators showing when data is real-time vs. base estimate.
  * Implement settings for update frequency / enable/disable real-time updates.
  * Handle potential API errors gracefully.

**Phase 5: Conflict Detection & Basic Resolution**

* **Goal:** Identify and visually flag conflicts, offer basic resolution.
* **Tasks:**
  * Implement Conflict Detection logic as described in the design.
  * Add `hasConflict`/`containsConflict` flags to data models and database.
  * Update UI: Display red dot indicators on affected items in the Itinerary View.
  * Implement UI to show details about the conflict (e.g., which segments overlap).
  * Implement the *automatic* re-planning attempt (simple shift-later strategy).
  * If auto-resolve fails or is disabled, potentially offer manual options (e.g., buttons like "Shift Later Manually", "Edit Segment").

**Phase 6: Polish & Advanced Features**

* **Goal:** Improve usability, robustness, and add advanced capabilities.
* **Tasks:**
  * **UI/UX Refinements:** Drag-and-drop reordering, smoother animations, better map visualizations (show full itinerary route).
  * **Advanced Re-planning:** Explore suggesting alternative routes or times if simple shifting fails.
  * **Notifications:** Optional notifications for upcoming steps or detected conflicts.
  * **User Preferences:** Preferred transport modes, cost vs. time weighting.
  * **Offline Support:** Cache routes/schedules where possible. Graceful handling when offline.
  * **Testing:** Comprehensive unit, integration, and UI testing (Espresso).
  * **Analytics & Crash Reporting:** Integrate Firebase or similar.
  * **(Optional Future):** User Accounts & Cloud Sync (Firebase Auth/Firestore).

This roadmap provides a structured approach, delivering value incrementally and tackling complex features like real-time updates and conflict resolution after the core structure is solid.
