6. (15pts) Consider the one of the previous two problems (LPP or GDP) that you proved to be NP-complete. We refer to this problem as NPCP (for NP-complete problem).

    * (3pt) Is the NPCP a number problem? Briefly explain why.

    * (6pts) Is the NPCP problem strongly or weakly NP-complete? If it is strongly NP-complete, explain why. This need not be a complete proof, merely an argument or explanation. You may refer to your previous proof without reproducing it. If it is weakly NP-complete, give a pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm to solve it.

    * (6pts) Consider the sub-problem of NPCP in which we restrict the input space to only DAGs. Is this problem strongly NP-complete, weakly NP-complete, or in P? You may refer to your previous proofs, or describe a polynomial- or pseudo-polynomial-time algorithm or methodology to solve the problem and explain the implications.

# Analysis of the Longest Path Problem (LPP)

## Is LPP a number problem?

Yes, LPP is a number problem. It involves numeric values (edge weights) that can be arbitrarily large, and the problem asks whether there exists a path with a specific numeric sum (L). The complexity depends not only on the graph structure (number of vertices and edges) but also on the magnitude of these numeric values. The decision version specifically asks if there exists a path with weight exactly equal to a given number L.

## Is LPP strongly or weakly NP-complete?

LPP is **strongly NP-complete**. 

This is because the problem remains NP-complete even when all the weights are restricted to small values. In my previous reduction from the Hamiltonian Path problem, I used a graph where all edge weights were set to 1, and the problem was still NP-complete. The hardness comes from the combinatorial structure of finding a simple path, not from the magnitude of the weights.

If LPP were only weakly NP-complete, there would exist a pseudo-polynomial time algorithm that could solve it when the weights are bounded by a polynomial in the input size. However, no such algorithm exists because even with unit weights, the problem remains hard due to the exponential number of possible simple paths between two vertices.

## LPP restricted to DAGs

When LPP is restricted to Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), the problem is **in P** (polynomial time).

This is because in a DAG:
1. We can topologically sort the vertices in O(V+E) time
2. Once we have a topological ordering, we can use dynamic programming to find the longest path:
   
```
Algorithm: LongestPathInDAG(G, source, target)
1. Compute a topological ordering of the vertices
2. Initialize dist[v] = -∞ for all vertices v
3. Set dist[source] = 0
4. For each vertex u in topological order:
   For each edge (u,v):
      dist[v] = max(dist[v], dist[u] + weight(u,v))
5. Return dist[target]
```

This algorithm runs in O(V+E) time, which is polynomial.

The key insight is that DAGs have a fundamental property (acyclicity) that allows for efficient path finding using dynamic programming, whereas in general graphs, the presence of cycles makes the longest path problem inherently difficult.
